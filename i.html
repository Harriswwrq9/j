<h1> why dogs are better than cats</h1>
<p>    If there is one thing I know, it is that dogs are better than cats. There are many compelling reasons why you should get a dog and not get a cat to be a pet. Trust me, you will be happier if you have a dog.  

    Dogs are man's best friend because they feel like humans feel and they will act like a best friend. They are also trusting and loyal. They like being petted and touched. They will stick with you and they will be there for you. And dogs will actually love you ‒ not like cats. Cats always want to do their own thing and don't want to have anything to do with humans.

    Dogs are much more fun to play with than cats. Something that dogs can do that cats can't is play with you. They like to go outside and play. You can play Frisbee with them. You can throw tennis balls with them. You can go for a jog with them.

    You can actually train a dog. You can teach tricks like "Sit", "Stay", "Down", "Roll Over", and "Fetch". Dogs can also learn to shake and to walk by your side. You can train a dog to be a service animal who can help disabled people. They can do things like open doors. They can guide blind people. You don't see cats helping people. Some dogs are therapy dogs. They can calm people, help people in need, and be emotional support. They can also just be a good friend as well.

    Dogs can be rescue dogs. There have been multiple stories in the news about dogs saving people. They can protect your home better than a cat. Say there's an intruder. Dogs can be trained to bite them. They can also have an aggressive bark which will scare the intruder away. They can be heroes. Dogs can bark to get your attention to notify you there is something wrong. They will wake you up when the house is on fire.

    Dogs help you get exercise. Dogs can run with you. They require you to walk them and that helps you to stay in shape. Another benefit of walking with dogs is it helps you make friends. A lot of people love dogs so whenever you walk them in a public area, people will sometimes talk to you.

    Cats jump on things that dogs don't ‒ like counters and computers. Also, cats are known for pushing glasses and other valuable things off counters and scratching everything. They scratch couches, pillows, mattresses ‒ anything. Dogs never do that.

    Dogs comfort you. They know when you're sad. Dogs will stick by your side. Dogs are happy even when you are grumpy. They listen when you talk, or at least they seem to. They will put you in a better mood.

     Dogs have a larger variety of body types that are all adorable! They come in more shapes and sizes. They have long or short snouts. They can either have straight or curly hair. They can be big or small. They can have perked-up or droopy ears. They can have different tails. Cats only have one main body form ‒ no matter what type of cat they are. So, with a dog, you can get whatever size and shape you want. You can even get one that doesn't cause allergies.

    Dogs also have different personalities. Dogs can be happy and frisky. You can get a dog that either looks like you or matches your personality.

    When you get a cat, you have to buy a litter box as well. If you don't clean it right away, litter boxes can start to smell. Litter boxes can also take up room. With dogs, you can take them out for a walk and let them poop on someone else's property. :)

    With all these facts, it's obvious that

    You should get a dog, and not a cat.
